Our mission is to worship and exalt God with the gifts he's given... 

To introduce the lost to Christ and bring believers closer to Christ all over the world...

And to break every strong hold and every yoke with the anointing that God has placed over this ministry. 

We pray people are healed and delivered in the name of Jesus. 

And that after all is said and done we are NOT just a good show but also a vessel to salvation.
